# Group website project

## Todo

The Todo list will be where the tasks to be completed are. Along with the list of people assigned to certain tasks. 

## Src

The src directory is where all of the source code will live. HTML, CSS, JS. 

## Scripts

Scripts are where I will write code that will hopefully automate the development process somewhat. 

## Docs
The docs folder is where things such as the client breif and todo list are. This will also have a log of the errors and issues we are having.
